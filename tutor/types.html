 <h1 class="cyan">Types of Hackers</h1>
 <h3>Your choices makes you who you are</h3>
 <p> <span class="cyan">Script Kiddies</span> - script kiddies in a word are noobs. They are the people who use tools, scripts, methods, and programs created by real hackers. They are  the one who do not know a system works but are still able to exploit with previusly available tools, not by walking in the footsteps of actual hackers but simply copying what they did and use it for malicious purposes.</p>

 <p> <span class="cyan">White Hat Hacker</span> - White Hat Hackers or <span class="cyan">penetration testers</span> are the good guys who hacks for security purposes. Although what they do is pretty much same with the bad guys, but a world of differences comes in the world of ethics. The main aim of a white hat hacker is to improve the security of a system by finding security flaws and fixing it before the bad guys find and exploit it. They are usually officially empployed by organizations and companies to protect their virtual assets from harm. They may also workn individually to make the cyberspace more secure, kind of a voluntary worldwide community service. An example of this is the team behind the infamous hacking tool named <span class="cyan">Metasploit</span> who work tirelessly reporting new security flaws and their fixes in various softwares. </p>

 <p> <span class="cyan">Black Hat Hacker</span> - They are the enemies. They are the bad guys, cyber criminals who have malicious intent. These are the hackers who steal money or valuable data, infect systems with viruses, trojans, malwares, etc. These are the ones who gave the world of hacking a bad reputation. They use their hacking skills for illegal purposes with unethical goals and would love to watch the world burn.</p>

<p> <span class="cyan">Grey Hat Hackers</span> - These are the hackers who may work offensively or defensively, depending on the situation. They belonmg to the neutral zone. Hackers who don't have malicious intentions but still like to break into third-party system just for the thrill of fun or maybe just to announce a newfound vulnerability in a wild and supposedly heroic way. Nobody like a show off and a grey hat can do that. </p>

<p> <span class="cyan">Hacktivists</span> - They are the hackers who use their hacking skills for protesting against injustice and attack a target system or websites to popularize a notion or gather attention to specific case for rectification. They are the vigilantes, the dak knights of the hacking universe. This is where good intentions collide with the law, for hacktivists may or may not carry out illegal activities to get their points around the world. They include outlaws who deliver their own brand of rough justice, they are usually experts confident in their stealth skills so as not to get caught. </p>
