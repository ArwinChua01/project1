 <h3>How much is too much?</h3>

 <p>What we covered in thye previous tutorials bareky even scratched the surface of batch file viruses. AS more and more viruses are developed, the antivirus softwares are keeping up with an equal pace to stop them. Batch file viruses represent the ver beginning of any kind of viruses. Today, however, almost every single suspicious batch file is an easy target for an antivirus. Most AV will not let you execute them, even if they do, the batch file will be quickly shut down from execution as the AV realises that it is malicious. Further, batch file viruses are the first ones to show up on any virus scan.</p> 

 <p>So, why bother? Whats the point of learning how to make batch file viruses? Their practical potential is next to nothing, they are easy to find, easy to delete, and spreading them is out of the question. </p>

 <h3 class="cyan">It is a start.</h3>

 <p>That is pretty much the only reason why batch viruses are important. They are taught all over the world in various hacking coursesn fpr good reason. every hacking forum, every comment section below a hacking video or a blog is filled with people looking for a way into the vast hacking universe. This is it. The more <span class="cyan">out of the box</span> a virus or a malicous tool is, the harder it is to pin down and identify. But to get to the complex stuff, one needs to master the basics first. Even though something like the innocent batch viruses dont have the boom, they pave the way for greater things. You probably can't take out a every computer in the internet using a batch virus, but you will be able to format an unprotected computer, you will be able to shut down a computer everytime on startup, etc. This may not be enough reward for most people to put in the effort, but without a foundation you cannot soar high. Everyone has to start somewhere and there is no better place than batch programming.</p>

 <p>Learning how to make batch files gives you a glimpse of the much more complex world of advanced programming as well as how basic viruses are made and how they work. Lastly, no security system is completely foolproof. Unseen things can and go wrong, which is what hacking is all about and who knows, perhaps you will be the next one to find a big loophole.</p>
